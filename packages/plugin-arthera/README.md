# @elizaos/plugin-arthera

This plugin provides actions and providers for interacting with the **Arthera blockchain**.

## Description

The Arthera plugin enables seamless interaction with the Arthera blockchain, focusing on native token transfers. It provides dynamic configuration for Arthera-specific RPCs and facilitates token operations with ease.

## Features

- **Arthera-specific support**:
  - Native token transfers using **AA**.
  - Wallet balance tracking.
- **Dynamic RPC configuration** for the Arthera chain.
- Comprehensive transaction management.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm install @elizaos/plugin-arthera
```

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```env
# Required
EVM_PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key-here

# Optional - Custom RPC URL for Arthera
ARTHERA_PROVIDER_URL=https://rpc.arthera.net
```

### Chain Configuration

The plugin is pre-configured for the Arthera chain. To add additional configurations, modify your character settings as needed.

Example configuration for Arthera:

```json
"settings": {
    "chains": {
        "evm": [
            "arthera"
        ]
    }
}
```

Note: The chain names must match those in the viem/chains.

### Custom RPC URL

By default, the plugin uses the public RPC URL for Arthera. To set a custom RPC URL, add the following to your `.env` file:

```env
ARTHERA_PROVIDER_URL=https://your-custom-rpc-url
```
